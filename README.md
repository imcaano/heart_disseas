# Heart Disease Prediction System 🏥

## What is this project? 🤔
This is a special computer program that helps doctors and people check if someone might have heart problems. It's like having a smart assistant that can look at different health numbers and tell us if we need to see a doctor.

## How does it work? 🎯
1. You enter some health information (like age, blood pressure, etc.)
2. Our smart computer looks at this information
3. It tells you if you might have heart problems or not
4. It saves this information so doctors can look at it later

## Main Parts of the Project 📁

### 1. The Brain (Model) 🧠
- File: `predict.py`
- This is like the smart part of our program
- It looks at your health numbers and makes a prediction
- It uses special rules to decide if there might be heart problems

### 2. The Website (Frontend) 🌐
- Files in `templates/` folder
- This is what you see on your computer screen
- It has nice buttons and forms to enter information
- Shows you the results in a friendly way

### 3. The Backend (PHP) ⚙️
- File: `index.php`
- This is like the manager of our program
- It connects all the different parts together
- Makes sure everything works smoothly

### 4. The Database (Storage) 💾
- File: `heart_disease.sql`
- This is like a big filing cabinet
- Stores all the information safely
- Keeps track of all predictions and users

## How to Set Up the Project 🛠️

### 1. Setting Up the Computer
1. Install XAMPP (it's like a special toolbox for our project)
2. Put all our files in the `htdocs` folder
3. Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP

### 2. Setting Up the Database
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Create a new database called `heart_disease`
3. Import the `heart_disease.sql` file
4. This creates all the tables we need

### 3. Setting Up Python
1. Install Python on your computer
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install scikit-learn
   pip install joblib
   ```

## How the Model Makes Predictions 🎯

1. **Input**: The model looks at 13 different health numbers:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Chest pain type
   - Blood pressure
   - Cholesterol
   - And more...

2. **Processing**: The model:
   - Checks each number
   - Gives points based on risk
   - Adds up all the points

3. **Output**: The model says:
   - "Positive" if points are high (might have heart problems)
   - "Negative" if points are low (probably healthy)

   - Scale them to same range
   - Check for valid values

2. **Prediction Steps**
   - Each tree makes a guess
   - Trees vote on final answer
   - If more trees say "yes" = Positive
   - If more trees say "no" = Negative

3. **Risk Score Calculation**
   ```
   High Risk Factors:
   - Age ≥ 65: +3 points
