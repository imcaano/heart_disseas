- Build comprehensive reports system
- Develop full admin panel
- Add dataset import functionality

### 3. Add Missing Assets
- Create/download app icons and images
- Add Inter font files
- Include sample animations
- Add placeholder data

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Test all API integrations
- Validate blockchain functionality
- Test prediction accuracy
- Performance optimization

**Remaining:**
- Environment setup and dependencies
- Complete feature implementations
- Asset files
- Testing and optimization

## 📋 To Run the App

1. **Install Flutter SDK** (if not already installed)
2. **Navigate to flutter_app directory**
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🔗 Integration with Existing System

The Flutter app is designed to work with your existing:
- ✅ PHP backend APIs
- ✅ MySQL database
- ✅ Python ML model
- ✅ Blockchain integration

The app will communicate with the same endpoints and use the same data structures as your web version.

**Note:** The app structure is complete and ready for development. The main blocker is the Flutter environment setup and dependency installation. Once that's resolved, the app should run and connect to your existing backend system.
